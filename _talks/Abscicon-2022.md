In MuLTEE, we observed microscopic clusters give rise to macroscopic multicellular forms as Hsp90 expression declined. To test whether this shift was causal, we overexpressed the Hsp90 paralogs HSC82 and HSP82, initially shrinking cluster size but then continuing selection for large groups. Strikingly, HSC82-overexpressing lineages rapidly evolved macroscopic clusters within 60 days, far earlier than in the original experiment, suggesting that tuning Hsp90 regulation can accelerate multicellular size evolution.
