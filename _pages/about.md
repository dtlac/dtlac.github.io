# **Welcome to my scientific journey!**

> My scientific path is intentionally interdisciplinary. I began with a BSc in Biotechnology at University of Science in Ho Chi Minh city, Viet Nam, where I worked on biomaterials and hydrogel-based drug delivery systems for tissue repair with [Dr. Hieu Tran-Van](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u90y7U4AAAAJ&hl=en) and the [GMIF Biomedical Research Group](https://www.facebook.com/BioMed.GMIF/about). This early training shaped how I think about biological structure, material properties, and function.
>
> I went on to complete an MSc in Biology at Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia, focusing on microbiome research and host–microbiome interactions with [Dr Kuk-Jeong Chin](https://cas.gsu.edu/profile/kuk-jeong-chin/). This phase of my training provided hands-on experimental experience with microbial systems and molecular techniques, and it played a key role in preparing me to move into my career in biological research.
>
>In 2021, I joined the [Ratcliff lab](https://ratclifflab.biosci.gatech.edu/) led by [Dr. William Ratcliff](https://biosciences.gatech.edu/people/will-ratcliff) at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, where I became involved in long-term evolution experiments exploring the origins of multicellularity. I progressed from Research Technician to Research Scientist I, and my current work integrates experimental evolution, genetics, and systems-level approaches to understand how biological complexity arises and persists over evolutionary time.
