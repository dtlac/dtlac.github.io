In this paper, we observed a single multicellular ancestor diversify into coexisting small and large cluster lineages that specialized on a trade-off between growth rate and survival. This coexistence is maintained by size-dependent competition for oxygen, revealing how the emergence of multicellular individuality can rapidly drive adaptive diversification and niche expansion.
