Using a long-term evolution experiment in snowflake yeast, we identified oxygen availability as a key constraint shaping the evolution of multicellular size [(Oxygen suppression of macroscopic multicellularity)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23104-0). In this paper, we further unveiled that the transition from microscopic to macroscopic multicellularity was driven by biophysical adaptations, including increasingly elongated cells that reduced packing constraints and promoted branch entanglement.
