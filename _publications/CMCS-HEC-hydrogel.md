FGF-2 is a powerful driver of wound healing, but its clinical potential has been limited by instability and rapid degradation. This study shows that CMCS/HEC hydrogel films can protect FGF-2 and release it in a sustained, bioactive form, enhancing fibroblast proliferation and growth factor stability. In a murine burn model, FGF-2–loaded hydrogels accelerated tissue regeneration, promoted angiogenesis, and reduced scarring.
