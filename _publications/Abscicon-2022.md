In MuLTEE, we observed microscopic clusters give rise to macroscopic multicellular forms as [Hsp90 expression declined](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.adn2706). To test whether this shift was causal, we overexpressed the Hsp90 paralogs HSC82 and HSP82, initially shrinking cluster size but then continuing selection for large groups. Strikingly, HSC82-overexpressing lineages rapidly evolved macroscopic clusters within 60 days—far earlier than in the original experiment—suggesting that tuning Hsp90 regulation can accelerate multicellular size evolution.
