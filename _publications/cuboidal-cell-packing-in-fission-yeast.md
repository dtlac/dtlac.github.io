Using experimental evolution in fission yeast, we show that simple multicellularity can rapidly arise through the evolution of cuboidal cell packing, displacing unicellular ancestors. These cuboidally organized clusters exhibit hallmarks of a transition in individuality, including heritable group size, emergent life cycles driven by physical fracture, and adaptation to group-level selection. Strikingly, this transition is repeatedly driven by mutations in ace2, a mechanism convergently reused across fungi separated by hundreds of millions of years.
