We showed that selection for larger multicellular size during MuLTEE rapidly drives the evolution of tetraploidy, which arises early and persists for thousands of generations despite genomic instability. Tetraploidy is favored because it immediately increases cell length and cluster size, providing a direct fitness advantage that prevents reversion to diploidy. Once established, this whole-genome duplication opens new evolutionary pathways, enabling conserved aneuploidy and the emergence of macroscopic multicellular forms.
