Using the MuLTEE long-term evolution experiment, we show that increased multicellular size and toughness arise through cellular elongation driven by down-regulation of the chaperone Hsp90, which delays mitosis by destabilizing the kinase Cdc28. These results reveal how tuning ancient protein-folding systems can uncover new developmental phenotypes and fuel evolutionary transitions in biological individuality.
