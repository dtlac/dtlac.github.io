A crucial step in the origins of current day biodiversity and life has been the evolution of multicellular life forms from single celled organisms. A key contribution to the evolution of multicellularity has been the large scale changes in genetic makeup of organisms. In this study, we use a special yeast which grows in small clusters of yeast cells attached in a 'snowflake' like network. We had previously found that over just 600 days of growth and selection, these clusters under low oxygen conditions become visible to the naked eye attaining a macroscopic size. These changes were not only accompanied by a duplication of the entire genome of the yeast. but also certain patterns of chromosomal irregularities (aneuploidy). In this study, we compare the genetic makeup of the larger (macroscopic) and smaller (microscopic) yeast clusters. We found that the switch between small and large sizes was related to the gain or loss of certain chromosomes, which also had specific genetic mutations. This suggests that the yeast's size change wasn't random but driven by specific genetic alterations. Overall, this research indicates that the growth into larger, multicellular organisms can be driven by both chromosomal irregularities (aneuploidy) and new genetic mutations.
